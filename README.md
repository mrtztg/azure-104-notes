### 💵 Setting Cost Budgets in Azure

To set cost budgets in Azure:

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** in the Azure portal.
2. Select **Budgets** from the left menu.
3. Click **+ Add** to create a new budget.
4. Configure the budget:
   - **Scope**: Select the subscription, resource group, or management group.
   - **Budget name**: Give it a descriptive name.
   - **Reset period**: Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually.
   - **Budget amount**: Set the spending limit.
5. Set **Alert conditions** (optional):
   - Configure alerts at different thresholds (e.g., 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%).
   - Add email recipients or action groups for notifications. In **Manage Action Groups**, you can define automated actions to take place when a budget threshold is reached (such as **running an automation**, **sending SMS**, **stop all VMs**, or **triggering webhooks**).
6. Click **Create** to save the budget.

Budgets help monitor and control spending by sending alerts and taking automated actions when thresholds are reached.
