- Balance brevity with exam-relevant information.

### Structure

- **Use emojis in section titles** (e.g., `## 💰 Cost Management`).
- Organize content in `README.md` with clear hierarchical sections.
- Use appropriate markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks).

  - Configuration details
  - Common use cases

  - Important limitations or considerations
- Prioritize practical, actionable information over theory.

### Code Snippets and Templates
